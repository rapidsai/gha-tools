# Initializes a `pip` constraint file. Ensures that environment variable
# `PIP_CONSTRAINT` is populated and points to a file that exists.
#
# This allows the unconditional use of that variable + script in CI scripts, like this:
#
#     source rapids-init-pip;
#     LIBRMM_WHEELHOUSE=$(
#       RAPIDS_PY_WHEEL_NAME="librmm_cu12" rapids-get-pr-wheel-artifact rmm 1909 cpp
#     )
#     echo "librmm-${RAPIDS_PY_CUDA_SUFFIX} @ file://$(echo "${LIBRMM_WHEELHOUSE}"/librmm_*.whl)" >> "${PIP_CONSTRAINT}"
#
# This is intended to be `source`'d, not invoked as an executable.
#
# Note that the exact name `PIP_CONSTRAINT` is specifically recognized by `pip`:
# https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-c. Exporting it is important
# to ensure that the constraints are respected by all calls to `pip`, including nested
# calls that happen when setting up an isolation build environment for wheel builds.
