# the "pr-builder" job to pass for all PRs. It's implied that that job depends
# on all other jobs in the workflow.

# An optional argument can be passed to ignore certain jobs from the check.
# The argument should be a space-separated list of job names, e.g.:
#  rapids-check-pr-job-dependencies "job1 job2 job3"
